This direcroty contains the output of the following simulation: 

We use the Plasma Simulation Code (Germaschewski et al., 2016), to simulate the collision of 8
counter propagating Alfv ́en waves, four parallel and four antiparallel to the magnetic field. All waves
have random phases and fulfill the critical balance theory by Goldreich and Sridhar (1995) . 


km,par ρi = C (|km,⊥|ρi)^(2/3)

or in terms of di

km,par di = Cβ^(−1/6) (|km,⊥ |di )^(2/3)
 .
C= 10^(-4/3) 
 
The simulation box size is Lx × Ly × Lz = 24di × 24di × 125di and the spatial resolution is ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 0.06di ,
where di is the ion inertial length and is di = 1. The mass ratio is mi/me = 100. The plasma beta
for both ions and electrons is βi = βe = 1. We use Isotropic temperature for both ion and electrons.
We use equal number of particles per cell for ions and electrons ne = ni = 100. The background
magnetic field is B0 = B0z ˆ . We use B0 = VA/c = 0.1 in order to keep thermal velocities below the
speed of light and avoid relativistic effects. VA is the Alfv ́en speed and c is the speed of light. The
ion plasma frequency is ωpi = 1, the courant factor is cfl=0.98 and the time step is 0.06/ωpi. Each snapshot
is taken every 400 steps or 24 tωpi.

This run has km,par = 2π/125di and km,⊥ = 2π/6di. 

The perpendicular part is already in the breakdown from inertial to kinetic range.


These data were produced using the Data Intensice at Leicester (DIaL) fascility provided by the DiRAC project
dp126 Identifying and Quantifying the Role of Magnetic Reconnection in Space Plasma Turbulence.
